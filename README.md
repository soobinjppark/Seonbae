# Seonbae

Seonbae is a web application that provides a platform for students to connect with alumni for job opportunities. Seonbae allows students to post their information and specific companies they'd want to receive referrals for. Alumni of the school then can view the postings and decide whether there's a match, and potentially reach out to the student with an opportunity or a referral.
